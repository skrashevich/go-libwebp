// ISO/IEC TR 24731-2:2010 defines the __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT2__

//    __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__ instead (C2X does not define
//    __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__), while a few features from TS

//    __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__ even when C2X features are
//    enabled).
//
//    __GLIBC_USE (IEC_60559_BFP_EXT) controls those features from TS

//    18661-1 that are also included in C2X (with no feature test macro

//
//    __GLIBC_USE (IEC_60559_EXT) controls those features from TS 18661-1
//    that are included in C2X but conditional on

//    conditional on __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__ that are not in TS
//    18661-1.)

// WEBP_RESTRICT

// Declares a pointer with the restrict type qualifier if available.
// This allows code to hint to the compiler that only this pointer references a
// particular object or memory region within the scope of the block in which it
// is declared. This may allow for improved optimizations due to the lack of
// pointer aliasing. See also:
// https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/restrict

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CPU detection

// WEBP_HAVE_* are used to indicate the presence of the instruction set in dsp
// files without intrinsics, allowing the corresponding Init() to be called.
// Files containing intrinsics will need to be built targeting the instruction
// set so should succeed on one of the earlier tests.

// The intrinsics currently cause compiler errors with arm-nacl-gcc and the
// inline assembly would need to be modified for use with Native Client.

// Note: ARM64 is supported in Visual Studio 2017, but requires the direct
// inclusion of arm64_neon.h; Visual Studio 2019 includes this file in
// arm_neon.h. Compile errors were seen with Visual Studio 2019 16.4 with
// vtbl4_u8(); a fix was made in 16.6.

// This macro prevents thread_sanitizer from reporting known concurrent writes.

// Defines an Init + helper function that control multiple initialization of
// function pointers / tables.
// Usage:
//    WEBP_DSP_INIT_FUNC(InitFunc) {
//      ...function body
//    }

// If 'ptr' is NULL, returns NULL. Otherwise returns 'ptr + off'.
// Prevents undefined behavior sanitizer nullptr-with-nonzero-offset warning.

//    glibc includes corresponding *f128 interfaces for it.  The required
//    libgcc support was added some time after the basic compiler
//    support, for x86_64 and x86.

// Defined to 1 if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1 and the type is ABI-distinct
//    from the default float, double and long double types in this glibc.

// Defined to 1 if the current compiler invocation provides a
//    floating-point type with the right format for _Float64x, and this
//    glibc includes corresponding *f64x interfaces for it.

// Defined to 1 if __HAVE_FLOAT64X is 1 and _Float64x has the format
//    of long double.  Otherwise, if __HAVE_FLOAT64X is 1, _Float64x has
//    the format of _Float128, which must be different from that of long
//    double.

// Defined to concatenate the literal suffix to be used with _Float128
//    types, if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1.

// Defined to a complex binary128 type if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1.

// The remaining of this file provides support for older compilers.

// long double is distinct from double, so there is nothing to
//    define here.

// This header should be included at the bottom of each bits/floatn.h.
//    It defines the following macros for each _FloatN and _FloatNx type,
//    where the same definitions, or definitions based only on the macros
//    in bits/floatn.h, are appropriate for all glibc configurations.

// Defined to 1 if the current compiler invocation provides a
//    floating-point type with the right format for this type, and this
//    glibc includes corresponding *fN or *fNx interfaces for it.

// Defined to 1 if the corresponding __HAVE_<type> macro is 1 and the
//    type is the first with its format in the sequence of (the default
//    choices for) float, double, long double, _Float16, _Float32,
//    _Float64, _Float128, _Float32x, _Float64x, _Float128x for this
//    glibc; that is, if functions present once per floating-point format
//    rather than once per type are present for this type.
//
//    All configurations supported by glibc have _Float32 the same format
//    as float, _Float64 and _Float32x the same format as double, the
//    _Float64x the same format as either long double or _Float128.  No
//    configurations support _Float128x or, as of GCC 7, have compiler
//    support for a type meeting the requirements for _Float128x.

// Defined to 1 if the corresponding _FloatN type is not binary compatible
//    with the corresponding ISO C type in the current compilation unit as
//    opposed to __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOATN, which indicates the default types built
//    in glibc.

// Defined to 1 if any _FloatN or _FloatNx types that are not
//    ABI-distinct are however distinct types at the C language level (so
//    for the purposes of __builtin_types_compatible_p and _Generic).

// Defined to concatenate the literal suffix to be used with _FloatN
//    or _FloatNx types, if __HAVE_<type> is 1.  The corresponding
//    literal suffixes exist since GCC 7, for C only.

// Defined to a complex type if __HAVE_<type> is 1.

// If double, long double and _Float64 all have the same set of

// ISO C Standard:  7.17  Common definitions  <stddef.h>

// Any one of these symbols __need_* means that GNU libc
//    wants us just to define one data type.  So don't define
//    the symbols that indicate this file's entire job has been done.

// This avoids lossage on SunOS but only if stdtypes.h comes first.
//    There's no way to win with the other order!  Sun lossage.

// Sequent's header files use _PTRDIFF_T_ in some conflicting way.
//    Just ignore it.

// On VxWorks, <type/vxTypesBase.h> may have defined macros like
//    _TYPE_size_t which will typedef size_t.  fixincludes patched the
//    vxTypesBase.h so that this macro is only defined if _GCC_SIZE_T is
//    not defined, and so that defining this macro defines _GCC_SIZE_T.
//    If we find that the macros are still defined at this point, we must
//    invoke them so that the type is defined as expected.

// In case nobody has defined these types, but we aren't running under
//    GCC 2.00, make sure that __PTRDIFF_TYPE__, __SIZE_TYPE__, and
//    __WCHAR_TYPE__ have reasonable values.  This can happen if the
//    parts of GCC is compiled by an older compiler, that actually
//    include gstddef.h, such as collect2.

// The fallback definitions, for when __WCHAR_MAX__ or __WCHAR_MIN__
//    are not defined, give the right value and type as long as both int
//    and wchar_t are 32-bit types.  Adding L'\0' to a constant value
//    ensures that the type is correct; it is necessary to use (L'\0' +
//    0) rather than just L'\0' so that the type in C++ is the promoted
//    version of wchar_t rather than the distinct wchar_t type itself.
//    Because wchar_t in preprocessor #if expressions is treated as
//    intmax_t or uintmax_t, the expression (L'\0' - 1) would have the
//    wrong value for WCHAR_MAX in such expressions and so cannot be used
//    to define __WCHAR_MAX in the unsigned case.

// Determine the wordsize from the preprocessor defines.

// WEBP_RESTRICT

// Declares a pointer with the restrict type qualifier if available.
// This allows code to hint to the compiler that only this pointer references a
// particular object or memory region within the scope of the block in which it
// is declared. This may allow for improved optimizations due to the lack of
// pointer aliasing. See also:
// https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/restrict

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CPU detection

// WEBP_HAVE_* are used to indicate the presence of the instruction set in dsp
// files without intrinsics, allowing the corresponding Init() to be called.
// Files containing intrinsics will need to be built targeting the instruction
// set so should succeed on one of the earlier tests.

// The intrinsics currently cause compiler errors with arm-nacl-gcc and the
// inline assembly would need to be modified for use with Native Client.

// Note: ARM64 is supported in Visual Studio 2017, but requires the direct
// inclusion of arm64_neon.h; Visual Studio 2019 includes this file in
// arm_neon.h. Compile errors were seen with Visual Studio 2019 16.4 with
// vtbl4_u8(); a fix was made in 16.6.

// This macro prevents thread_sanitizer from reporting known concurrent writes.

// Defines an Init + helper function that control multiple initialization of
// function pointers / tables.
// Usage:
//    WEBP_DSP_INIT_FUNC(InitFunc) {
//      ...function body
//    }

// If 'ptr' is NULL, returns NULL. Otherwise returns 'ptr + off'.
// Prevents undefined behavior sanitizer nullptr-with-nonzero-offset warning.

// Regularize the definition of WEBP_SWAP_16BIT_CSP (backward compatibility)

// some endian fix (e.g.: mips-gcc doesn't define __BIG_ENDIAN__)

// Warning! This macro triggers quite some MACRO wizardry around func signature!

// We'll REMOVE the 'const char label[]' from all signatures and calls (!!):

// The Boolean decoder needs to maintain infinite precision on the value_ field.
// However, since range_ is only 8bit, we only need an active window of 8 bits
// for value_. Left bits (MSB) gets zeroed and shifted away when value_ falls
// below 128, range_ is updated, and fresh bits read from the bitstream are
// brought in as LSB. To avoid reading the fresh bits one by one (slow), we
// cache BITS of them ahead. The total of (BITS + 8) bits must fit into a
// natural register (with type bit_t). To fetch BITS bits from bitstream we
// use a type lbit_t.
//
// BITS can be any multiple of 8 from 8 to 56 (inclusive).
// Pick values that fit natural register size.

// be decoded. Hence, deblocking is lagging behind by 4 or 8 pixels (depending
// on strength).
// With two threads, the vertical positions of the rows being decoded are:
// Decode:  [ 0..15][16..31][32..47][48..63][64..79][...
// Deblock:         [ 0..11][12..27][28..43][44..59][...
// If we use two threads and two caches of 16 pixels, the sequence would be:
// Decode:  [ 0..15][16..31][ 0..15!!][16..31][ 0..15][...
// Deblock:         [ 0..11][12..27!!][-4..11][12..27][...
// The problem occurs during row [12..15!!] that both the decoding and

//    support, for x86_64 and x86.

// Defined to 1 if the current compiler invocation provides a

// long double is distinct from double, so there is nothing to
//    define here.

// This header should be included at the bottom of each bits/floatn.h.
//    It defines the following macros for each _FloatN and _FloatNx type,
//    where the same definitions, or definitions based only on the macros
//    in bits/floatn.h, are appropriate for all glibc configurations.

// Defined to 1 if the current compiler invocation provides a
//    floating-point type with the right format for this type, and this
//    glibc includes corresponding *fN or *fNx interfaces for it.

// Defined to 1 if the corresponding __HAVE_<type> macro is 1 and the
//    type is the first with its format in the sequence of (the default
//    choices for) float, double, long double, _Float16, _Float32,
//    _Float64, _Float128, _Float32x, _Float64x, _Float128x for this
//    glibc; that is, if functions present once per floating-point format
//    rather than once per type are present for this type.
//
//    All configurations supported by glibc have _Float32 the same format
//    as float, _Float64 and _Float32x the same format as double, the
//    _Float64x the same format as either long double or _Float128.  No
//    configurations support _Float128x or, as of GCC 7, have compiler
//    support for a type meeting the requirements for _Float128x.

// Defined to 1 if the corresponding _FloatN type is not binary compatible
//    with the corresponding ISO C type in the current compilation unit as
//    opposed to __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOATN, which indicates the default types built
//    in glibc.

// Defined to 1 if any _FloatN or _FloatNx types that are not
//    ABI-distinct are however distinct types at the C language level (so
//    for the purposes of __builtin_types_compatible_p and _Generic).

// Defined to concatenate the literal suffix to be used with _FloatN
//    or _FloatNx types, if __HAVE_<type> is 1.  The corresponding
//    literal suffixes exist since GCC 7, for C only.

// Defined to a complex type if __HAVE_<type> is 1.

// The remaining of this file provides support for older compilers.

// If double, long double and _Float64 all have the same set of
//    values, TS 18661-3 requires the usual arithmetic conversions on
//    long double and _Float64 to produce _Float64.  For this to be the
//    case when building with a compiler without a distinct _Float64
//    type, _Float64 must be a typedef for long double, not for
//    double.

// * if MALLOC_FAIL_AT is defined, the global environment variable
